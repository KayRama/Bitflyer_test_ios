Question 1 
What kind of data structure is needed to represent the layout of a widget?

Answer:
To represent the layout of a widget, we can use a tree-like data structure. I think my choice is a tree of widgets where each widget has properties such as its position, size, and children. Because is like tree.

Question 2 
Implement a process to calculate the frame of each widget based on the data you answered in question 1.

Answer:
To calculate the frame of each widget, we need to calculate the position and dimensions of the widget's boundaries. But I fail to manage that

Question 3 
Implement a function that calculates how the data you answered in question 1 changes when a widget is dropped at a given coordinate. It should be implemented as a function with no side effects, and you should write a unit test.

Data before drop + arbitrary coordinates + widget to be dropped
        => Data when dropped at an arbitrary coordinate

I Think for the questions 3 is hard to me, because I never write a unit test.

Question 4 
Using the implementations from Questions 1 to 3, please
implement a solution that meets the requirements.

I canâ€™t answer the questions number 4, because I still not finishing my code.
